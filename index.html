            MSc Financial Mathematics with Data Science - Aspiring Quantitative Analyst / PhD student
          </p>

          <p>
            I am a recent graduate from the University of Bath where I completed my Masters in
            Financial Mathematics with Data Science. I am extremely passionate about both
            Mathematics and Financial Markets, and I enjoy applying my skills in programming to
            solve problems at the intersection of these two fields.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have always been extremely interested in mathematics from a very young age due to my love and ability of solving problems, puzzles and namely maths equations with my father before school. 
            This interest has only grown over time fueling my extra curricular interests suchs as playing chess, building computer systems, and diagnosing and repairing cars. 
            Unsuprisingly, I also have a strong interest in music playng grade 8 drums as maths and music have many similarities in their structure and patterns which I find fascinating. 
          </p>

          <p>
            I am currently exploring both pathways into a PhD in applied probability or machine
            learning, and entry-level quantitative roles within industry. In either setting, I’m
            particularly interested in solving mathematical problems, working closely with real data
            and contributing to model design and implementation.
