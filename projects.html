          <strong>MSc Dissertation - Martingale Defect in Asset Price Bubbles (79%)</strong><br />
          Developed continuous SDE and jump-driven strict local martingale models in Python to study asset price bubbles.
          Used Monte Carlo methods to generate option prices and applied option-implied diagnostics (e.g. put-call parity violations and the bubble gap) to detect and quantify bubble effects.

        <li>
          <strong>Monte Carlo Methods for Option Pricing (89%)</strong><br />
                  Implemented Monte Carlo simulations with Euler-Maruyama schemes to price European options under Black-Scholes and Heston models.
                  Investigated convergence by varying time steps and strikes, and used variance-reduction techniques to improve estimator accuracy.

          <strong>Interest Rate Model Calibration (82%)</strong><br />
          Streamlit app that pulls option chains, cleans the surface and computes bubble-gap metrics
          under Black-Scholes, CEV and SABR-type models.

        <li>
          <strong>FX Derivatives Market Maker - Cardiff University (78%)</strong><br />
          Acted as an FX derivatives market maker, providing quotes, executing trades and hedging FX exposure using options. 
          Analysed P&L decomposition and risk exposure using the Greeks and summarised performance in a final report.

        <li>
          <strong>US Equity Market Intraday Trader - Cardiff University (80%)</strong><br />
            Designed and backtested an intraday trading strategy for a US equity in Python using RSI-based indicators. 
            Forward-tested the strategy via paper trading in TWS and evaluated performance using return and risk measures.
